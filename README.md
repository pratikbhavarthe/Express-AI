Express AI is a cool tool that lets you teach your own smart computer without needing to be a computer expert. You don't have to write any complicated code. 
You can tell your computer to do up to six different things, and you can even show it pictures to help it learn better. Once your computer is smart enough, you can download it and make it work on your own. 
It's like having your own little helper that you can train to understand and do things just the way you want!
